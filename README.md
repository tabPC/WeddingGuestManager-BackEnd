# WeddingGuestManager-BackEnd
Hello! This is my first Spring Boot repo: the backend for my mini project, a Wedding Guest Manager web-app built with Spring Boot and Angular.
See the frontend repo here: https://github.com/tabPC/WeddingGuestManager-FrontEnd

This is set up for my developmental purposes, and lacks the applications.properties file, which is necessary to run.

Please see these resources used: [Spring Boot Full Stack with Angular Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx4iBLKLVHk&t=4444s&ab_channel=Amigoscode)

Also see my post about this app on my [Portfolio Website](https://tabchemelli.com/wedding-guest-manager-beginner-spring-boot-angular-app/)
