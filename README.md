# WeddingGuestManager-BackEnd
Hello! This is my first Spring Boot repo: the backend for my mini project, a Wedding Guest Manager web-app built with Spring Boot and Angular.
See the frontend repo here: https://github.com/tabPC/WeddingGuestManager-FrontEnd

This is set up for my developmental purposes, and lacks the applications.properties file, which is necessary to run.
